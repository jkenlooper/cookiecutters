# Cookiecutter Collection 

Get started by installing the [python cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).

Each cookiecutter is in it's own directory, so when using the cookiecutter
command the `--directory` option will need to be used. An example of using the
design-tokens cookiecutter:

```bash
cookiecutter --directory design-tokens \
  https://github.com/jkenlooper/cookiecutters.git
```
